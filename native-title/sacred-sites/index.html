	<h1>Sacred Sites</h1>
	<h2 id="what-is-a-sacred-site">What is a sacred site?</h2>
	<p>Sacred site means a site that is sacred to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people or is otherwise of significance according to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tradition.</p>
	<p>Sacred sites are given protection under Federal and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.environment.gov.au/topics/heritage/laws-and-notices/indigenous-heritage-laws/protection-under-state-and-territory-laws">various State laws</a>.</p>
	<p>Indigenous heritage can be protected under <a target="_blank" href="https://www.environment.gov.au/topics/heritage/laws-and-notices/indigenous-heritage-laws/protection-under-state-and-territory-laws">State</a> or Territory heritage laws to varying degrees. Usually State and Territory laws automatically protect various types of areas or objects, while enabling developers to apply for a permit or certificate to allow them to proceed with activities that might affect Indigenous heritage.</p>
	<h2 id="northern-territory">Northern Territory</h2>
	<p>In the Northern Territory all places that are sacred or otherwise of significance according to Aboriginal tradition are protected under the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00556">Land Rights Act</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="http://notes.nt.gov.au/dcm/legislat/legislat.nsf/d989974724db65b1482561cf0017cbd2/49c74a6701b79ee869257bd7000b320f/$FILE/ATT4U88M.pdf/Repn027.pdf">Northern Territory Aboriginal Sacred Sites Act 1989</a>. Sacred sites are protected on all forms of land tenure including freehold land.</p>
	<p>The effect of the above is that in the Northern Territory all sacred sites are given global protection under Commonwealth and Territory laws. This fact creates an imperative for companies, exploring for minerals, planning mining operations or any other work that may disturb the landscape, to find out in advance where sacred sites are located before commencing their projects.</p>
	<p>Under the laws in force in the Northern Territory Aboriginal custodians have statutory rights which amount to a significant legally recognised interest in areas which fall within the definition of a &lsquo;Sacred site&rsquo; contained in the Land Rights Act. These rights include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the right of access to such sacred sites in accordance with Aboriginal tradition regardless of the underlying land tenure (s.46);</li>
	<li>the right to authorise other people (both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal) to cross any land whether it be public or private land for the purposes of entering a sacred site (s47)(4).</li>
	<li>the right to refuse permission for persons to enter or remain on a sacred site (s.43);</li>
	<li>the right to determine the nature and extent of works (if any) that may be undertaken on or in the vicinity of a sacred site (s.20).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Sacred Sites Act sets out clear procedures for persons wishing to carry out works in the Territory (such as mining exploration) to obtain authoritative information on the constraints (if any) imposed by the existence of sacred sites in the areas of their proposed activities. Although the Act requires the Authority to commence consultation within 60 days of receiving an application, complex projects in remote areas are likely to require significantly longer than this to obtain clearance.</p>
