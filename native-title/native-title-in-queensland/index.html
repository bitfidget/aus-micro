	<h2>Case study</h2>

	<h3>Gladstone Liquefied Natural Gas</h3>
	<p>The GLNG project involves piping coal seam gas (CSG) from Santos' eastern Queensland fields to a plant at Gladstone, where the gas will be liquefied. In August 2010, Santos announced it had signed 42 individual ILUAs with Aboriginal people for the GLNG project. Agreements are now in place from Gladstone through to Roma and cover production areas in the Surat and Bowen basins in central Queensland and a pipeline corridor to Gladstone. Exports are expected to commence in 2015.</p>
