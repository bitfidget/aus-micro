	<h2>Case study</h2>

	<h3>Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu)</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/parks/find/devilsmarbles#.VjIAIFUrLIU">Devils Marbles or Karlu Karlu</a>, a tourist attraction 100 kms south of Tennant Creek in Australia's Northern Territory, were returned to traditional owners in 2008. The Ayleparrarntenhe Aboriginal Land Trust now holds the title to Karlu Karlu and immediately signed 99-year leases with the NT government to allow public access to the area. A new era of Joint Management of this Reserve has begun with traditional owners and Park Rangers now working together in partnership to manage the Reserve for the future.</p>
