	<h1>Native Title in the Northern Territory</h1>
	<p>A list of current Northern Territory Native Claims are available from the <a href="http://www.nntt.gov.au/searchRegApps/NativeTitleRegisters/Pages/Search-Register-of-Native-Title-Claims.aspx" target="_blank">National Native Title Tribunal</a>.</p>

	<h3>Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu)</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/parks/find/devilsmarbles#.VjIAIFUrLIU" target="_blank">Devils Marbles or Karlu Karlu</a>, a tourist attraction 100 kms south of Tennant Creek in Australia&rsquo;s Northern Territory, were returned to traditional owners in 2008. The Ayleparrarntenhe Aboriginal Land Trust now holds the title to Karlu Karlu and immediately signed 99-year leases with the NT government to allow public access to the area. A new and exciting era of Joint Management of this Reserve has begun with Traditional Owners and Park Rangers now working together in partnership to manage the Reserve for the future.</p>
