	<h1>Native title in Western Australia</h1>
	<p>A list of current Western Australian native title claims are available from the <a href="http://www.nntt.gov.au/searchRegApps/NativeTitleRegisters/Pages/Search-Register-of-Native-Title-Claims.aspx">National Native Title Tribunal</a>.</p>
	<p>The combined area of registered and determined native title claims over Western Australia is approximately 90% of the State's land mass. Some claims include inter-tidal and sea areas.</p>
	<p>To assist claim management, the State is divided into six regions.  The <a href="https://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/lantu/Claims/Pages/Default.aspx">Land Approvals and Native Title Unit website</a> contains links to find out what native title applications and determines currently exist in each of the six regions. A <a href="/engagement-guide/western-australia-information-on-engaging-with-traditional-owners#access-permits">mining tenement</a> cannot be granted unless it has satisfied the future act  requirements of the Native Title Act. <a href="http://dmp.wa.gov.au/">The Department of Mines and Petroleum</a> have produced a number of resources to assist in assessing the impact on native title and determining the scope of an agreement. Additionally, the WA Department of Premier and Cabinet provides a useful guide called the <a href="https://www.dpc.wa.gov.au/lantu/MediaPublications/Documents/Guide%20for%20Third%20Party%20Indigenous%20Land%20Use%20Agreements%20Version%201-1-10-March.pdf">Guide for Third Party ILUAs</a>.</p>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/laa1997200/">Land Administration Act 1997</a> also allows Aboriginal people in Western Australia to practice traditional hunting in unfenced or unimproved pastoral leases.</p>

	<h3>Burrup and Maitland Industrial Estates Agreement</h3>

	<p>In the Pilbara region, the Burrup and Maitland Industrial Estates Agreement</p>
	<p>Implementation Deed (the Burrup Agreement) was signed in January 2003 between Woodside and three Aboriginal groups. The industrial estate contains onshore facilities of Woodside's North West Shelf Venture, one of the world's largest LNG producers. The Burrup Agreement allowed for the acquisition of native title and provides for the establishment of an Aboriginal Body Corporate, the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, to manage financial and other benefits of the agreement.</p>
