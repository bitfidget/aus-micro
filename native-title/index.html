	<h1>Native Title</h1>
	<p>Native Title is a form of land title that recognises the traditional connection, rights and interests of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with the land.</p>
	<a id="why-does-it-exist"></a>
	<h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
	<p>Native Title recognises Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander property rights and interests arising from traditional law and custom. This traditional relationship has both spiritual and material dimensions. It was first recognised by common law by the High Court of Australia in the <a href="https://www.reconciliation.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NRW2014_3-June-Mabo_FactS.pdf" target="_blank">Mabo Case</a> (1992). Native Title was then formally recognised under the <a href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04665" target="_blank">Native Title Act (Cth) 1993</a>.</p>
	<p>The <a href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04665" target="_blank">Native Title Act (Cth) 1993</a> provided a framework to determine where Native Title still exists, as well as to ensure that existing land interests, largely non-Indigenous, were still valid. The <em>Act</em> also ensures processes for creating interests over Native Title land, such as mining tenements.</p>
	<a id="what-does-native-title-mean"></a>
	<h2>What does Native Title mean?</h2>
	<p>Native Title rights, where they exist, can co-exist with other forms of title such as pastoral leases but can be extinguished by others, including <a href="#what-does-title-mean">freehold title</a>.</p>
	<p>Native Title can be claimed in the following areas:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Vacant or unallocated Crown land</li>
	<li>Some state forests, national parks and public reserves, subject to the relevant State legislation</li>
	<li>Oceans, seas, reefs, lakes and inland waters</li>
	<li>Some leases (such as non-exclusive pastoral and agricultural leases), subject to the lease terms and relevant State legislation</li>
	<li>In some cases land held by Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Native Title is said to be extinguished and cannot be claimed:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>On freehold land (granted on or before 23 December 1996), except for freehold land held by or on behalf of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people</li>
	<li>When certain things have been done with the land, such as freehold grants, grants of exclusive possession, residential and other leases and public works like roads and hospitals.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Source: <a href="http://www.nntt.gov.au/Pages/Home-Page.aspx" target="_blank">National Native Title Tribunal</a></p>
	<p>Native Title is different from a freehold or leasehold interest in that:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the rights derive from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander traditional lore and customs and are not derived from statute; and</li>
	<li>they must relate to land and waters - they may be communal, group or individual, but are not transferable.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The <a href="https://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/Portals/0/docs/Agreement-making-with-Indigenous-Groups.pdf" target="_blank">Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining</a> has produced a guide on Agreement Making With Indigenous Groups including useful case studies of successful mining and resources development projects on Native Title land.</p>

	<h2>Case study</h2>
	<h3>Argyle Mines, Western Australia - land mark participation agreement between Rio Tinto and Traditional Owners</h3>
	<p>2014 saw the tenth anniversary of the landmark <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/sd2014/casestudies/ten-years-of-argyle-participation-agreement.html" target="_blank">Argyle Participation Agreement</a> between Rio Tinto and the Traditional Owners of the mine, the Gija and Mirriuwung people. When the Participation Agreement was signed a decade ago, it set a new benchmark in Australia for land use agreements between resource companies and Traditional Owners: it created not only income streams for future generations of local Aboriginal people, but also significant training, employment and business development opportunities and a voice for Aboriginal people in mining decisions affecting their interests. For example, during the negotiation of the Agreement, Argyle provided an undertaking that was probably unique in the history of the mining industry: Argyle would not proceed with its plans for an underground mine without the approval of the Traditional Owners.</p>
	<h3>One of the world&rsquo;s largest Bauxite Mines - the Western Cape Communities Co-existence Agreement</h3>
	<p>The Agreement known as the Western Cape Communities Co-existence Agreement relates to one of the world&rsquo;s largest bauxite mines now operated by Rio Tinto. It is also known as the Comalco Indigenous Land Use Agreement. The signatories include 11 Traditional Owner groups in Queensland, four Indigenous Community Councils (Aurukun, Napranum, Mapoon and New Mapoon), Comalco Aluminium Limited and the Cape York Land Council on behalf of the Native Title Parties. The Queensland Government is also a signatory and agreed to provide additional financial benefits on registration of the agreement.&nbsp; The ILUA covers two Mining Leases but includes consent for any "extensions, renewals or replacements" required to access and transport materials between the areas. The parties also consent to the Queensland Ports Corporation granting land and rights necessary for Comalco to carry out their interests in the agreement area, which includes shipping goods in and out of Weipa. The ILUA specifies that this consent is not intended "to preclude the application of any law concerned with the protection of Aboriginal cultural heritage or environmental protection".</p>

	<h2 id="future-acts-and-indigenous-land-use-agreements">Future Acts and Indigenous Land Use Agreements</h2>
	<p>A &lsquo;Future Act&rsquo; is an activity or proposal that may affect Native Title interests. Common Future Acts include the grant of mining. In these situations, a Native Title group may have a &lsquo;Right to Negotiate&rsquo;, meaning that the two parties are required to negotiate in good faith about the potential activity which is expected to affect the Native Title interests. The <a href="http://www.nntt.gov.au/futureacts/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">National Native Title Tribunal</a> provides information about negotiating future acts and may play a role in assisting the parties to reach agreement through mediation.</p>
	<p>Irrespective of whether there is a Native Title claim, the <a href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04665" target="_blank">Native Title Act</a> must be complied with. For example, Traditional Owners can negotiate with third parties who wish to engage in activities on a pastoral lease where the proposed activity falls outside the defined pastoral purposes. Consequently, where a third party wishes to use the land for non-pastoral purposes, Native Title must be addressed. The party may negotiate directly with Traditional Owners to ratify an <a href="
/landtenure/how-do-I-engage-with-title-owners/northern-territory-information-on-engaging-with-traditional-owners-and-land-councils#indigenous-land-use-agreements">Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA)</a>, a legal document which provides them with consent to undertake certain activities on the land.</p>

	<h2>Benefits of Indigenous Land Use Agreements:</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>deal with a wide range of Native Title matters such as the consent to future acts, compensation, protection of significant sites and culture, how Native Title rights and interests can be exercised alongside other interests;</li>
	<li>provide certainty for other parties who wish to carry out activities and developments on the land and waters in the agreement area even before Native Title has been determined;</li>
	<li>are processed, notified and registered in most instances within a period of less than 6 months; and</li>
	<li>offer an alternative to making a Native Title determination application.</li>

	<h3>Devils Marbles (Karlu Karlu)</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.parksandwildlife.nt.gov.au/parks/find/devilsmarbles#.VjIAIFUrLIU" target="_blank">Devils Marbles or Karlu Karlu</a>, a tourist attraction 100 kms south of Tennant Creek in Australia&rsquo;s Northern Territory, were returned to traditional owners in 2008. The Ayleparrarntenhe Aboriginal Land Trust now holds the title to Karlu Karlu and immediately signed 99-year leases with the NT government to allow public access to the area. A new and exciting era of Joint Management of this Reserve has begun with Traditional Owners and Park Rangers now working together in partnership to manage the Reserve for the future.</p>
