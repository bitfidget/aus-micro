	<h1>Future Acts and Indigenous Land Use Agreements</h1>
	<p>A &lsquo;Future Act&rsquo; is an activity or proposal that may affect Native Title interests. Common Future Acts include the grant of mining. In these situations, a Native Title group may have a &lsquo;Right to Negotiate&rsquo;, meaning that the two parties are required to negotiate in good faith about the potential activity which is expected to affect the Native Title interests. The <a href="http://www.nntt.gov.au/futureacts/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">National Native Title Tribunal</a> provides information about negotiating future acts and may play a role in assisting the parties to reach agreement through mediation.</p>
	<p>Irrespective of whether there is a Native Title claim, the <a href="https://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A04665" target="_blank">Native Title Act</a> must be complied with. For example, Traditional Owners can negotiate with third parties who wish to engage in activities on a pastoral lease where the proposed activity falls outside the defined pastoral purposes. Consequently, where a third party wishes to use the land for non-pastoral purposes, Native Title must be addressed. The party may negotiate directly with Traditional Owners to ratify an <a href="
