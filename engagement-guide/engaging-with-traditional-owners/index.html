	<h1>Engaging with traditional owners </h1>
	<p>This section provides a general overview of how to approach engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</p>
	
	<h2>Working in partnership with Indigenous communities</h2>
	<p>Many traditional owner groups throughout Australia are passionate and optimistic about the opportunities that investment and economic development hold for the future of their peoples. There are many examples of past and current development projects on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander land:</p>

	<h2>Case study</h2>
	<h3>Newmont gold mine - Tanami Desert</h3>
	<p>Mining on Aboriginal land contributes more than a billion dollars a year to the Northern Territory economy and accounts for 80 percent of the Territory's income derived from mining. In the <a href="http://www.clc.org.au/">Central land council</a> region, a large area of <a href="http://www.clc.org.au/articles/cat/mining/">mining activity</a> occurs west of Alice Springs in the Tanami Desert where Newmont operates the Granites gold mine. Thousands of square kilometres of land are under exploration.</p>

	<p>The key to engaging with land councils and traditional owners is to build a relationship, with an emphasis on starting discussions early and allowing enough time for community to consider the opportunity and reach decisions before the formal agreement process commences.</p>
	<p>From an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspective, the initial contact with you is critical to building trust and rapport, and will help ensure the future success of any engagement, and negotiations about land tenure and economic opportunities.</p>
	
	<h2>How do I structure the engagement process?</h2>
	<p>Engagement approaches and negotiation processes need to take into account the demands on the resources of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and land councils. This leads to effective targeting of resources and a consistent approach being taken where engagement and negotiations might and need to occur. The first step is to seek preliminary information about the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and land area of interest.</p>
	<p>The Australian Government, in consultation with its <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/indigenous/committees/iac.html">Indigenous Advisory committee</a>, has developed a <a href="https://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/consultation/engage-early-indigenous-engagement">draft set of guidelines</a> which aims to improve how proponents engage and consult with Indigenous people.</p>
	<p>A summary of key things to factor in to your engagement approach:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Be mindful of the competing demands placed on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation workers.</li>
		<li>Spend time getting to know the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership and decision-making structures in the areas you have identified for potential investment and opportunities.</li>
		<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should be actively informed about the engagement approaches, and negotiation processes and options provided. This is achieved through transparent conduct, regular communication, engagement and follow up activities with land councils and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</li>
		<li>Maintain regular visits to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to become familiar with the local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture, and to build trust and strengthen relationships. This will also assist to identify if there are any significant or emerging considerations in the community.</li>
		<li>Ensure the initial engagement occurs in a culturally appropriate manner and is attended by people who are acceptable to both the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people you are meeting with and their community. This includes awareness that an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person may only feel comfortable meeting with a worker of the same gender.</li>
		<li>It could be advantageous to identify employment opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to gain work experience throughout the engagement and negotiation process.</li>
