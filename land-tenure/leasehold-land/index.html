	<h2>What does title mean?</h2>
	<p>Leasehold land is a land holding that is leased to a person or company by the relevant State (as the Crown). However, it is critical to note that, where applicable, all mineral rights are reserved to the Crown.</p>
	<p>A lease of freehold land is not leasehold land, the land remains freehold.</p>
	<p>There are different forms of leasehold tenure types across the States. Two thirds of Crown-owned land in northern Australia is under <a href="/land-tenure/pastoral-leases/">pastoral leasehold</a>.</p>
	<p>Generally, under a lease the lessee is granted the right to exclusive occupation of the land. Under a licence, the licensee has a right of access on the land on certain defined conditions.</p>
	<p>Leasehold land tenure can typically be summarised as either:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Term lease -  usually between a 1 to 50 year lease for a specified purpose. Some term leases issued by the Crown have been extended to up to 100 years (eg for significant development).</li>
		<li>Perpetual lease - a lease in perpetuity may be used only for the purpose for which the lease is issued.</li>
		<li>Freeholding lease - where approval has been granted to convert a lease to freehold and the lessee elects to pay the purchase price in instalments. The freeholding lease is an interim tenure and the freehold title will not be issued until the purchase price, plus any interest, is fully paid.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Who can lease land in Australia?</h2>
	<p>Both individuals and corporations can lease land in Australia. The underlying freehold title holder continues to own the freehold title in the land.</p>
