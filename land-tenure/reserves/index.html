	<p>Crown reserves are land set aside by the Government on behalf of the community for a wide range of public purposes, including sites for environmental and heritage protection, recreation and sport, open space, community halls, special events and government services. This results in a diversity of reserve types, ranging from beaches, caravan and camping grounds, cemeteries, racecourses, showgrounds, community halls, sporting fields and parks, walking tracks, canoe and kayak trails, smaller ports and harbours to wharfs. Reserves are unlikely to be available for commercial activity that is inconsistent with the purpose of the reservation.</p>
	<p>Each State or Territory government will have different purposes for which land may be reserved.</p>
