	<h1>Crown Land</h1>
	<p>Crown Land is known as all land which is &ldquo;remaining&rdquo; that has not been converted as <a href="#what-does-title-mean">freehold title</a> and is still held by the Crown.</p>
	<p>Crown land is regulated by the relevant State government legislation and certain requirements must be met before Crown land can be dealt with by, for example, being leased or sold.</p>
	<p>It is vested in the Government, although they may give another person the ability to manage or control that land. Examples of where the Crown may grant access or rights of control over the land include:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Crown lands held under lease including pastoral leases</li>
	<li>licence or permit</li>
	<li>community managed reserves</li>
	<li>lands retained in public ownership for environmental purposes</li>
	<li>lands within the Crown public roads network</li>
	<li>other unallocated lands.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Many non-tidal waterways and tidal waterway land across the state also comprise Crown land. These lands should not be confused with other forms of Crown or State owned lands such as National Parks, State Forests, State Rail property etc.</p>
