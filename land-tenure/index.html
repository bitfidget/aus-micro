	History of land tenure in Australia
	Land tenure is the name of the particular legal regime under which land is owned. It can be defined as the manner in which a party holds or occupies an area of land. 
	The general principles of land ownership are detailed in “common law” and have long been established in the Courts of Australia. It is important to note however, that the extent of ownership has changed significantly in interpretation over the last century, with many details now incorporated into Federal and State Legislation.
	Land tenure can also be referred to as the relationship between people and land. It is a way of identifying who has the right to use and occupy land in accordance with the different types of ownership. The rules that govern each of the ownership structures within Australia are the crux of all environmental and planning matters. The <a href="http://regional.gov.au/regional/ona/land-tenure/pdfs/land-tenure-20130717.pdf">CSIRO</a>  found that a fundamental understanding of this information is crucial to gaining a better understanding of: 
	•	The financial security in economic development and property markets; 
	•	Social stability through rights protection, housing and employment; 
	•	Development planning and economic growth strategy, and; 
	•	Natural resource, environmental and cultural management and sustainability.
	Land holding in Australia
	Land is generally referred to in two overarching categories:
	1.	Freehold land (including forms of freehold land tenure that are held by traditional owner groups including Aboriginal freehold).
	2.	Non-freehold land or Crown Land, which may either be leased or licensed. 
	General investor considerations
	Generally, mineral and petroleum resources on land will continue to belong to the Crown, irrelevant to the land tenure type.
