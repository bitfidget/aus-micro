	<h1>How do I engage with title owners?</h1>
	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	<p>The guide provides a general overview and tips on how to better engage and work effectively with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, organisations and communities across northern Australia. This information is intended to assist stakeholders to understand culturally responsive engagement approaches to engaging with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, organisations and communities. The guide also contains considerations relevant for the <a href="/how-do-i-engage-with-title-owners/northern-territory-information-on-engaging-with-traditional-owners-and-land-councils/">Northern Territory</a></p>
	<p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are diverse and have different beliefs, customs, traditions and cultural practices. This information is a general guide only and does not attempt to represent all views and approaches undertaken by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities across northern Australia. This guide is not intended to be a step-by-step guide but rather a general introduction with key considerations in engagement. Your engagement approach needs to be tailored in each situation and be underpinned by cultural responsive engagement.</p>
	<p>The overriding considerations for anyone seeking to engage with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are different.</li>
	<li>You need to allow sufficient time for effective engagement. It is best to engage in the early stages of project design rather than leaving it to final stages. Be prepared to develop relationships over time.</li>
	<li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the right to free, prior and informed consent, that is Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have the right to participate in decisions that affect them.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>As an investor you should know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are not opposed to development. There are many examples in Northern Australia of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who have allowed development to occur on their land. They do however want to have sufficient time to consider developments that affect their rights including their property rights.</p>
