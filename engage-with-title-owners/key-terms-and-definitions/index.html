	<p>The following definition, commonly known as 'The Commonwealth Definition', was given in a High Court judgement in the case of Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625.</p>
	<p>'An Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander is a person of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent who identifies as an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander and is accepted as such by the community in which he or she lives'.</p>
	<p>There are three components to this definition:</p>
	<p>1) descent;</p>
	<p>2) self-identification; and</p>
	<p>3) community acceptance.</p>
	<p>In practice, it is not feasible to collect information on the community acceptance part of this definition in general purpose statistical and administrative collections and, therefore, standard questions on Indigenous status relate to descent and self-identification only.</p>

	<li>Aboriginality cannot be judged by skin colour.</li>
	<li>The majority of Aboriginal people identify as such because it shows their connection to family, community and country.</li>
	<li>Many Aboriginal people have experienced discrimination and segregation, including through past Stolen Generation policies. This has an impact on their perception of non-Aboriginal service providers. Many continue to experience discrimination. Some people will choose not to identify as Aboriginal to service providers until they gain their trust.</li>
	<li>Significant grief and loss is experienced in Aboriginal communities nationally. Attending funerals and the mourning period is considered a high priority for all community members.</li>
